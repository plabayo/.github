[Plabayo](https://plabayo.tech/) is a European software studio based in Gent, Belgium,
focused on building resilient, interoperable, and secure digital infrastructure. We specialize
in strengthening network layers and supporting modern and legacy systems alike â€” whether
through free and open source contributions or commercial software.

Our philosophy is pragmatic: we build on shared standards, and contribute where we can make
the greatest impact.
Through tools like Rama and our consulting partnerships, we deliver high-integrity systems
that power digital innovation across sectors with confidence and resilience.

If you like our work and would like to donate to us, you can do so at <https://github.com/sponsors/plabayo>.
Part of the donations we receive we reuse for sponsoring back into projects we believe in and want to support.

We are available for events on premise within Belgium. Remotely we are open to any location and timezone.
