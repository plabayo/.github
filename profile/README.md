Plabayo was co-founded in 2021 by Elizabeth C. Gonzales Belsuzarri and Glen Henri J. De Cauwsemaecker,
as a Free and Open Source Software development and consultancy studio.

We are located in Ghent, Belgium and are available with events on premise within Belgium.
Remotely we are open to any location and timezone.

Education, Privacy and transparency is at the core of our mission.
We take our craft serious and work on the fringes of playfulness.
